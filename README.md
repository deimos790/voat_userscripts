# voat_userscripts
User scripts that make voat.co more usable to me.

VoatImageOpener is a clone of RES "view images" button. It expands all links and discussion posts. Seems to be error free.

VoatKeyboardNavigation has basic navigation down (move up down and expand). Currently there is an issue after reaching the end of the page.

Scripts are for use with [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)  for firefox or [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) for chrome.
